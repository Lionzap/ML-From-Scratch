## Models and Algorithms

Here is a list of models and algorithms included in this repository:

### Linear Regression

A simple yet powerful model used for predicting a continuous outcome. The implementation is straightforward, using gradient descent for optimization.

### Logistic Regression

Used for binary classification tasks, logistic regression predicts the probability of an outcome based on input features.

### Decision Trees

A versatile model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on feature values.

### Support Vector Machines

This model finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### Neural Networks

A basic implementation of a feedforward neural network. This includes layers, activation functions, and backpropagation.

### Deep Learning

Explore deep learning concepts with multi-layer neural networks. This section covers architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

### Reinforcement Learning

Implement basic reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, to understand how agents learn from their environment.

### Genetic Algorithms

This section explores optimization problems using genetic algorithms, mimicking natural selection processes.

## Usage

To use any of the models, navigate to the corresponding Python file in the repository. Each file contains usage examples and explanations.

For instance, to use the Linear Regression model, you can run:

```python
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5]

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict([[5], [6]])
print(predictions)
```

Refer to each model's documentation for specific usage details.
